# **App Name**: AI Model Showdown

## Core Features:

- Unified Input: Unified Input: Accept a single text prompt from the user.
- Parallel Queries: Parallel AI Queries: Simultaneously query multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, GLM) via their APIs. Uses a 'tool' pattern where the application decides which info from which models to include.
- Side-by-Side Display: Side-by-Side Output Display: Display the responses from each AI model in a clear, side-by-side format for easy comparison.
- Output Formatting: Output Formatting: Ensure consistent and readable formatting of AI model responses.
- Copy to Clipboard: Copy to Clipboard: Allow users to easily copy the output from any of the models to their clipboard.
- API Key Management: API Key Management: Securely store and manage API keys for different AI models. Consider the use of environment variables for local development.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a sense of futuristic technology and intelligence.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white, to ensure the focus remains on the AI-generated content.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#3F51B5) for interactive elements such as buttons and links, providing clear visual cues for user actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective look suitable for code or technical explanation. Clear and legible for code snippets and output.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different AI models.
- Divide AI outputs into distinct panels using subtle borders and shadows.
- Use smooth transitions and loading animations to provide a polished user experience.
